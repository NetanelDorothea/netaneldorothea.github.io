                <p>I am an international track student-athlete from Madonna university and I major in Computer Science.
                    I
                    was born on Curacao, a small island in the Caribbean, and lived my whole life in the Netherlands. I
                    was
                    initially interested in coding because of gaming. I thought it would be cool to be able to create my
                    own
                    game one day. After going to programming school I learned that you could do so much more than create
                    games. Being able to create is what I like the most about coding.</p>

                        handling. Students typically work on larger, more complex coding projects, often using languages
                        such as Java, Python, or C++. The course emphasizes writing efficient, reusable code and
                        debugging practices, preparing students for further study in computer science or software
